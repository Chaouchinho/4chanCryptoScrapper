We are expecting this move to increase the price of ICP to over $20 within a day of the news breaking- and in the long-term- the visibility provided by this will likely send ICP back to triple digits within the next 2 years. Very little can revealed at this time without screwing over the source of this information- but I can say that the company is NOT primarily involved with cryptocurrency- although they've been experimenting with it in recent years- and they are well known enough for there are a few news articles about this. Your window of opportunity to cheaply accumulate what will soon surpass Ethereum is closing quickly.

Monero is secure- low-fee- and fungible- meaning users can send XMR around the globe despite corrupt governments or broken financial systems. Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures- Stealth Addresses- and Ring CT ensure that Monero's blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words- the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain- with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key. Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees- dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further- the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining- preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly- the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin- the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022- where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network. If you still have questions- feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.
